# Keymaps
Keyboard keymaps.

## Features

### (Neo)Vim
I love (Neo)Vim. All of these keymaps, if possible, will include a layer shift key on the left hand and arrow keys on HJKL on the right hand.



## How-To
- Load any one of these up at [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/).
- Use [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox/releases) to flash them.
